## ðŸ“Œ Introduction to Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** is a subset of **Machine Learning** that uses neural networks with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brainâ€”albeit far from matching its abilityâ€”allowing it to "learn" from large amounts of data.

### âœ¨ Key Features:
- Learns from large datasets.
- Automatically extracts features.
- Powers applications like speech recognition, computer vision, and language translation.
