## 🏗️ Neural Networks Basics

### 🔹 What is a Neural Network?
A **Neural Network** is composed of layers of nodes, or "neurons," each connected to the next layer. Each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and passes on the output.

### 🔹 Components:
- **Input Layer**: Takes features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Processes inputs using weights and activation functions.
- **Output Layer**: Produces final result (e.g., classification).
- **Weights & Biases**: Learnable parameters.
- **Activation Function**: Adds non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).

---

## 🔢 Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

### ➤ Forward Propagation
- Inputs are multiplied by weights, bias is added, and passed through an activation function.
- Process continues layer by layer till the output.

### ➤ Loss Function
- Measures difference between predicted and actual output.
- Common Loss Functions:
  - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – Regression
  - **Cross Entropy** – Classification

---

## 🔁 Backpropagation & Gradient Descent

### ➤ Backpropagation
- Computes gradients of loss w.r.t weights using chain rule.
- Gradients are propagated backward to update weights.

### ➤ Gradient Descent
- An optimization algorithm to minimize the loss function.
- Update rule:  
  \( w = w - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial w} \)

Where:
- \( \eta \) is the learning rate
- \( L \) is the loss
- \( w \) is the weight

Here's a detailed explanation of **PyTorch** – one of the most powerful and popular deep learning frameworks.

---

# 🔥 PyTorch: Deep Learning Framework

---

## 📘 What is PyTorch?

**PyTorch** is an open-source deep learning framework developed by **Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR)**. It is widely used in both research and production due to its flexibility, ease of use, and dynamic computation graph.

---

## 🚀 Key Features of PyTorch

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔁 **Dynamic Computation Graph** | Graphs are built on-the-fly, allowing flexibility in model building. |
| 🧠 **Strong GPU Acceleration** | Supports CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs) for faster computation. |
| 🧪 **Pythonic and Intuitive** | Easy to learn and code; similar to NumPy. |
| 🔗 **Interoperability** | Works well with other Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc. |
| 📦 **TorchVision & TorchText** | Utility libraries for images and NLP tasks. |

---

## 🧱 Core Components

### 1. **Tensors**

Tensors are the fundamental building blocks in PyTorch (similar to NumPy arrays but with GPU support).

```python
import torch

# Create tensor
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
print(x)
```

### 2. **Autograd (Automatic Differentiation)**

Allows automatic computation of gradients (useful for backpropagation).

```python
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 3
y.backward()  # Calculates dy/dx
print(x.grad)  # Output: tensor(12.)
```

### 3. **Neural Network (torch.nn Module)**

Provides layers, loss functions, and model structure.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)
```

### 4. **Optimization (torch.optim Module)**

Used to update model parameters using gradients.

```python
import torch.optim as optim

model = Net()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```

### 5. **Loss Functions**

```python
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
output = model(torch.randn(1, 10))
target = torch.randn(1, 1)
loss = criterion(output, target)
```

---

## 🧠 Sample Workflow of Training a Model

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()       # Reset gradients
    output = model(inputs)      # Forward pass
    loss = criterion(output, targets)  # Calculate loss
    loss.backward()             # Backward pass
    optimizer.step()            # Update weights
```

---

## 📊 Example: Simple Linear Regression

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Sample data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
Y = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# Model
model = nn.Linear(1, 1)

# Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(100):
    y_pred = model(X)
    loss = criterion(y_pred, Y)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Trained weight:", model.weight.item())
```

## 🧰 When to Use PyTorch

- **When you need flexibility** during experimentation or research
- **When working on custom deep learning architectures**
- **For faster prototyping and debugging**

---

Sure! Here's a **brief but clear explanation** of **Hypothesis Testing**, which is a key concept in statistics and data science:

---

# 📊 Hypothesis Testing – Quick Guide

---

## ✅ What is Hypothesis Testing?

**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It helps you determine whether there is enough evidence to support a particular belief (hypothesis) about a dataset.

---

## 🔍 Key Terms

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Null Hypothesis (H₀)** | A default assumption that there is no effect or difference. Example: "There is no difference between A and B." |
| **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)** | The opposite of H₀. It suggests a real effect or difference exists. Example: "A is better than B." |
| **Significance Level (α)** | The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common values: 0.05, 0.01 |
| **P-value** | The probability of getting results at least as extreme as the observed result, assuming H₀ is true. |
| **Test Statistic** | A value calculated from sample data to test the hypothesis (e.g., Z-score, t-score). |

---

## 🔁 Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. **State the Hypotheses**:
   - H₀: The null hypothesis
   - H₁: The alternative hypothesis

2. **Choose a significance level (α)**:
   - Commonly 0.05 (5%)

3. **Collect sample data**

4. **Perform a statistical test**:
   - Z-test, t-test, chi-square test, etc.

5. **Calculate the test statistic and p-value**

6. **Make a decision**:
   - If **p-value ≤ α**, reject H₀
   - If **p-value > α**, fail to reject H₀

---

## ⚖️ Example

**Scenario**: A company claims its battery lasts 10 hours on average. You test 30 batteries and find a mean of 9.5 hours.

- H₀: μ = 10 (no change)
- H₁: μ ≠ 10 (change exists)
- α = 0.05

If the calculated p-value is 0.03 (less than 0.05), you **reject H₀** and conclude that the average battery life is different from 10 hours.

---

## 🔧 Types of Tests

| Test | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Z-test** | Large sample size, known population std dev |
| **t-test** | Small sample size, unknown std dev |
| **Chi-Square Test** | Categorical data and variance comparison |
| **ANOVA** | Compare means of 3 or more groups |

---

Sure! Here's a detailed but easy-to-understand explanation of **Confidence Intervals**, a key concept in statistics and data analysis:

---

# 📏 Confidence Interval (CI) – Explained

---

## ✅ What is a Confidence Interval?

A **Confidence Interval (CI)** is a range of values that’s likely to contain a population parameter (like a mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence.

> In simple terms:  
> A confidence interval tells you how sure you can be about your estimate.

---

## 📌 Why Use Confidence Intervals?

- To estimate **how accurate** a sample statistic (like sample mean) is for representing the true population value.
- More informative than just a single-point estimate (like just saying "average = 50").

---

## 📐 Structure of a Confidence Interval

\[
\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm Z \cdot \left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\]

Where:

- \(\bar{x}\): sample mean  
- \(Z\): Z-score (based on confidence level)  
- \(\sigma\): population standard deviation (or sample std if population σ is unknown)  
- \(n\): sample size

---

## 🔢 Common Confidence Levels

| Confidence Level | Z-score |
|------------------|---------|
| 90%              | 1.645   |
| 95%              | 1.96    |
| 99%              | 2.576   |

Example:
> "With 95% confidence, the average height is between 160 cm and 170 cm."

It means:
> If you took 100 different random samples and computed 100 confidence intervals, about 95 of them would contain the true population mean.

---

## 🧪 Example in Plain English

Let’s say:

- Sample Mean = 100  
- Std Dev = 10  
- Sample Size = 25  
- Confidence Level = 95% → Z = 1.96  

\[
CI = 100 \pm 1.96 \cdot \left(\frac{10}{\sqrt{25}}\right) = 100 \pm 1.96 \cdot 2 = 100 \pm 3.92
\]

So, the 95% CI is **[96.08, 103.92]**

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

- **Correct**: “We are 95% confident that the true mean lies between 96.08 and 103.92.”
- **Incorrect**: “There’s a 95% chance that the true mean is in this interval.” (That’s a misunderstanding in frequentist statistics.)

---

## 🐍 Bonus: Python Example

```python
import scipy.stats as stats
import numpy as np

data = [12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22]
n = len(data)
mean = np.mean(data)
std_err = stats.sem(data)
confidence = 0.95

ci = stats.t.interval(confidence, df=n-1, loc=mean, scale=std_err)
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: {ci}")
```
